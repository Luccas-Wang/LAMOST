   on run1_20171205 analysis run:
   @@@ problems / questions to check in current run:
     1. check why this image has a sstd = 835 for the bias medium data
	 rb-01r-20160101174212-stat.dat: 
	 image : 5 mean = 12.5559661079 , sstd = 835.769496222341

   @@@ data sanity check:
      1. plot the mean & sstd of bias images as a function of time
   @@@ features to add for future runs: 
     1. dump OS stat info to output for future analysis, such as
     checking device stability
