	understand the y and x dependence (less than 1/2 sigma ) of pixel values in the overscan regions (see figure below)

20171205:
   on run1_20171205 analysis run:
   @@@ problems / questions to check in current run:
     1. check why this image has a sstd = 835 for the bias medium data
	 rb-01r-20160101174212-stat.dat: 
	 image : 5 mean = 12.5559661079 , sstd = 835.769496222341

     2. bugs:

   @@@ data sanity check:
      1. plot the mean & sstd of bias images as a function of time

   @@@ features to add for future runs: 
     -- There are days with less than 5 bias files taken for each CCD, for example data of 20161224: each det has only 
        4 bias files. Modify python analyse code to take in data with less than 5 bias data files
     1. dump Overscan region stat info to output for future analysis, such as checking device stability 
     2. check if stat.dat & pixelList.dat both exist, if so, don't need to rerun the raw data file
